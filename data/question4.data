At first, I really enjoyed the movie. It had incredible special effects, but the plot quality was over all lacking. In general, I would not recommend someone to see this movie.
The creative genius from the director is astounding. The way he showed the thought process of characters was truly touching and each scene was filled with intense backstory.
